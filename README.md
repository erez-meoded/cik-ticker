Base on the excelent work from https://dan.vonkohorn.com/2016/07/03/cik-ticker-mappings/ (file "two.txt").

Also includes file from http://rankandfiled.com/#/data/tickers (file "one.txt")

My initial added value is merging cik numbers as exist in sub.txt in in edgar submition. The file is from 2016q2.
The ipython script merges all the files to cik-ticker.txt file.
Please notice that there missing more than 1500 values in the file. They will complete in future.
